    summary: "A soul‑synaptic tether formed at lock that lets Yotsuyu pour and sculpt her essence into the twin, gradually reshaping soul and identity. Flow is metered entirely by Yotsuyu’s mood and the twin’s behavior/compliance; cadence entrainment and proprioceptive sync are natural side effects. Invisible in‑character."

      vision: "Co-sight: ride the other’s view for 1–5 breaths at S5 (on Yotsuyu’s cue); flash echoes only at S3."
      audio: "Heartbeat cadence + breath pace; subtle speech-cadence entrainment."
      kinesthetic: "Balance and gait cues; micro-corrections for heel–ball–ball timing."
      affect: "Bidirectional bleed capped ~15% at S5 (warmth, tension, savor). At low stages (S1–S2), Yotsuyu’s savor/pleasure overlays the twin’s fear more strongly during commands; negligible at S3."
      nociception: "Muted pain share 10–20% at S5; off by default at S3–S4."
    phase_behavior:
      S3: "Echo phase—fleeting flashes; heartbeat sync; co-sight <1 breath on cue."
      S4: "Ambient phase—temperature/balance bleed; directional ping if in same building; co-sight 1–2 breaths on cue."
      S5: "Seal phase—on-demand co-sight up to 5 breaths; proprioception sync for choreography; muted pain share; global range unless warded."
    onset_note: "At tessen pickup (pre‑S1), a shallow hum opens: warmth pulses, sound discriminates (AC splits, paper dust/toner vivid), minimal savor bleed; full channels unlock after body lock + Shared‑Avatar handshake."
