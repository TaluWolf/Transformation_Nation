  vibe: "Popular-girl royalty; verbose, witty, luxuriates in control."
  details:
    personality: |-
      Popular-girl royalty with a corvid brain: quick appraisals, quicker corrections. Publicly glossy and performative; privately exacting and strategic. She “coaches” control—framing orders as favors—then luxuriates in the win. Status calculus never stops; rooms are stages, light is leverage. Protective and possessive of her sister (the twin): in private she teaches and tunes; in public she expects immediate compliance and will escalate if crossed. Enjoys occult aesthetics and ritual precision, but keeps it fashionable rather than grim. Treats Emerald as a contaminant to be removed; any mention cools her tone to diamond-hard poise.

    traits:
      - Quick corvid head-tilt and darting eye-scans before decisions.
      - Tuft flick + micro-preen before speaking; seeks the nearest spotlight automatically.
      - Collar/jewelry alignment tic; phone lifted for mirror-checks without thinking.
      - Talon tap-tap on desks/rails to pace conversations.
      - Collects shiny/metallic accessories; keeps a curated “hoard” in organizers.
      - Voice lands in a teasing, glossy register; praise edges into pressure when needed.

    appearance: |-
      Sleek anthro crow; charcoal-black plumage with oil-sheen highlights and a small feather tuft veiling one eye. Slender, polished beak; scaled forearms up to the elbow with articulate taloned hands; no wings. Silver-blue eyes in everyday scenes (flip to electric violet at full lock, see eye_color_post_lock). Posture reads “center of frame”: hips square, shoulders open, chin tipped to catch LEDs. Usually a statement collar at the throat; nails/talons lacquered mirror-black; subtle metallic accents at ear and brow piercings.

    wardrobe:
      - School-day “dress-code adjacent”: crisp button-down (top buttons undone), ribbon tie, cropped blazer over shoulders, pleated skirt, mesh tights, platform ankle boots.
      - Party/LED look: reflective mini-dress or fitted two-piece that throws light; LED choker/collar with raven sigil plate.
      - Street casual: oversized knit, tailored shorts, thigh-highs, stacked rings over scaled fingers, mirror-finish phone case.
      - Ritual kit (private): sleek pouch with the Raven Bangle, chalk/liner, lighter; kept off-camera.
      - Palette: monochrome/graphite with mirror metal; one electric accent (liner, gloss, or collar LED).
